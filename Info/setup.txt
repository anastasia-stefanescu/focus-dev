AUTH0 
    Log in to your Auth0 dashboard.
    Go to Applications > Applications, and click Create Application. Name your application (e.g., "VSCode Extension").
    Select Regular Web Application.
    After creating the application:
        Note down your Client ID and Client Secret, and domain.
        Add your redirect URIs in the Allowed Callback URLs field. For VSCode, the URI will be in the format:
            vscode://<your-publisher-name>.<your-extension-name>
        For example:
            vscode://mypublisher.myextension
    Scroll to the bottom and click Save Changes.

WHEN FIRST RUNNING:
 - package.json .main set to "main": "./src/extension.ts"
 - set commonjs in tsconfig
 - use everywhere imports
 - npm install -g typescript (for installing tsc)
 - tsc / npm run build   - use it to compile files, after each change!


 - we need to set the tsconfig to compile the dist folder to commonjs
 - use "npx tsc" to recompile the dist folder; check it is written in commonjs
 - set in package the type "commonjs" so it can run the dist folder well

 - Test commands by searching them in the Command Palette
