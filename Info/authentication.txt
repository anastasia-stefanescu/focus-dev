SCOPES

Scopes in authentication define the level of access or permissions that a token (and, consequently, your app or extension) has when interacting with a resource or API. 
Scopes act as a filter, specifying what actions can be performed and what data can be accessed.

ACCESS TOKEN:
 - It's a short-lived token used to authenticate API requests on behalf of the user.
 - Example: If you use GitHub’s authentication, the token lets your app perform actions like fetching repositories or reading user data.
Most tokens are either:
 - JWT (JSON Web Token): A self-contained token with encoded claims (e.g., user ID, issued time, expiry).
 - Opaque Token: A random string that the provider validates on its servers

Access tokens often expire after a short period (e.g., 1 hour).
If they expire, the app may use a refresh token (if provided) to get a new one without requiring the user to log in again.

Most tokens are "bearer tokens," meaning they grant access to whoever holds them. For this reason, you must keep tokens secure.


GET SESSION
// get a session: {id: <String>, accessToken: <String>, account: {label: <String>, id: <Number>}, scopes: [<String>,...]}
  // If the user is already signed in with the specified authentication provider, it fetches the existing session.
  // If no session exists or the requested scopes require it, it can prompt the user to sign in or authorize the required access.
  // The session includes an access token that extensions can use to interact with APIs or services that require authentication.
  const session = await authentication.getSession(AUTH_TYPE, [], { createIfNone: false });
