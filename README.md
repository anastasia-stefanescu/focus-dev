# Code Stats - Efficiency Tracker VSCode Extension for programmers 

A Visual Studio Code Extension (destined for self-use!) that monitors and puts together detailed statistics on developers’ activities within the IDE

## It tracks actions such as:
- writing code
- debugging
- executing code
- rewieving code
- importing code from external sources
